# TellTale_Kotlin
Kotlin project to be submitted to google india.<br/>
Things I learnt in building this project: Livedata, ViewModels, DataBinding, Jetpack Navigation.<br/>
Things yet to be improved: Unit tests, Different layouts for different orientation, Adding observers as to when an option has been clicked don't repeat clicking(yet to figure out), Deep Links.</br>
